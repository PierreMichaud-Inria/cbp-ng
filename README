GCC: version 12 or later
Clang: version 19 or later

To compile the default predictor:
./compile cbp

To compile a specific predictor:
./compile cbp -DPREDICTOR="gshare<>"

To simulate one trace with 1M instructions of warmup and up to 40M instructions
of measurement:
./cbp ./gcc_test_trace.gz test 1000000 40000000
or:
./run ./cbp ./gcc_test_trace.gz

The simulation output per traces is:
(1) trace name, (2) instructions, (3) branches, (4) conditional branches, (5) blocks, (6) extra cycles, (7) P1/P2 divergences, (8) P1/P2 divergences coinciding with block end, (9) P2 mispredictions, (10) P1 latency (cycles), (11) P2 latency (cycles), (12) dynamic energy per instruction (fJ)

To simulate all "compress" traces:
mkdir OUTDIR
./run_all ./cbp cbp6_traces/compress OUTDIR

To simulate all traces:
./run_all ./cbp cbp6_traces OUTDIR

To compute the number of mispredictions per instruction:
./ratio 2 9 OUTDIR

To compute the average IPC, CPI, EPI, and other average metrics:
./predictor_metrics.py OUTDIR

To compute the VFS score for a set of runs:
./predictor_metrics.py OUTDIR | ./vfs.py

To compute the VFS score for any IPC, CPI, and EPI:
./vfs.py 7,0.03,1500

To run one trace:
./reference ./gcc_test_trace.gz test 1000000 40000000
or
